Your customers have complained that Guestbook website is throwing 404 not found errors. Investigate and identify the root cause.

#### Simulate the scenario
**Run** the command below to simulate the scenario
```
curl -O https://ant332.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ant332-lab-guide-artifacts/mystery_script_2.sh && chmod +x mystery_script_2.sh && ./mystery_script_2.sh $URL3

```

#### Hint

Remeber we created ```apache-``` index? It will have useful information to troubleshoot.


#### Mystery Solved

Open Kibana, Double-click Discover tab. Then choose apache-* index pattern and search for 404 errors. You will see all the logs records that contain 404 errors. **Make sure the search bar on top is empty**

If you expand the the logs lines you will notice that 404 errors are being generated by paths that do not exist such as ```/index/menu.html``` and ```/index/contactus.html```

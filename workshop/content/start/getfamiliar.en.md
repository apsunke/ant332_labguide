For the lab today, you will primarily use two interfaces - AWS Cloud9 and Kibana. We recommend keeping both these open in your broswer as there will significant forth.

**AWS Cloud9** is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser. We will run all our commands from here.

**Kibana** is an open source data visualization plugin for Elasticsearch. It provides visualization capabilities on top of the content indexed on an Elasticsearch cluster. We will use Kibana to visualize all the logs and metrics.

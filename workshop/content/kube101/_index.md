Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration and scheduling platform. It's become very popular for web-scale deployments in recent years, as it reduces the operational complexity and time involved in deploying highly scalable infrastructure for service-oriented architectures.

We will be using the Amazon EKS service for deploying our Kubernetes clusters for the course of this workshop.

We will be using the `kubectl` CLI tool for interacting with our EKS cluster's API server.

The following cheatsheet describes some common commands to use with `kubectl` when interacting with your cluster. We will provide all the relevant commands throughput the lab, this document is just for your reference.
